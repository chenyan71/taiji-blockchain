The blockchain technology can be used for public and private. For the public chain, there is a native currency which is call taiji coin. The chain is called Taiji Chain. 

### Unit

For Taiji coin, the smallest unit is called shell and one taiji is 100,000,000 shells to support all programming languages to save it as four bytes long, the max number of taiji in a system would be 92233720368.54775807 which is 92 billion taiji for max transaction amount. 

### Fee

We have a flat fee that is based on the USD. For each simple transaction, the fee will be about 100th of 1 cent for each inner chain entry in a transaction. Let's call this the smallest fee unit. 

For a transaction with one debit and one credit in the same chain, the fee is 2 units. That means that one cent can perform 50 transactions like this. 

For an credit entry on another chain, it is 4 units, so typical one debit and one credit transaction across two chains will cost 5 units fee. That means you can perform 20 transactions with 1 cent. 

For any smart contract creation and execution, the fee can be queried from the smart contract api. It all depends on the operation complexity. 

For each debit entry or credit entry, you can put a note. For the first 8 characters, it is 2 fee units
for the next 8 chars, it is 4 fee units. next 8 chars will be 16 units and next will be 256 units. This is to force users to write shorter notes if possible.

The same data field is for smart contract as well. The same fee will be applied based on the smart contract size for the first time creation.  

### Taiji Supply

There will be 92233720368(just over 92 billion) Taiji coins in circulation. All coins will be created in the genesis block across 10 addresses. There might be more addresses if some investors buy coins before the mainnet is alive. Otherwise all supply will be coming from these 10 accounts. 

All capital raised will be used to support the future development of the light platform and the blockchain technology. 

As there is no mining, we don't pay coins for miners. All partner nodes and validator nodes are supported by the transaction fees. As we can support millions transactions per second, the amount of the fee should be good enough once we reach the critical mass. 


All Taiji coins are generated and owned by the following entities:

- Network New Technologies Inc. who owns the light platform including light-blockchain and infrastructure. 
- Enterprise Blockchain Lab who is a non-profit organization focusing on research and development.
- Taiji Chain Foundation who is a commercial arm to promote and market the public chain to partners.

The percentage is 50%, %15 and %35 for above entities.
