The blockchain technology can be used for public and private. For the public chain, there is a native currency which is call taiji coin. The chain is called Taiji Chain. 

### Unit

For Taiji coin, the smallest unit is called monetary unit (mu) and one taiji is 100,000,000 mu to support all programming languages to save it as four bytes long, the max number of taiji in a system would be 92233720368.54775807 which is 92 billion taiji for max transaction amount. 

### Fee

We have a flat fee that is based on the USD. For each simple transaction, the fee will be about 100th of 1 cent for each inner chain entry in a transaction. Let's call this the smallest fee unit. 

For a transaction with one debit and one credit in the same chain, the fee is 2 units. That means that one cent can perform 50 transactions like this. 

For an credit entry on another chain, it is 4 units, so typical one debit and one credit transaction across two chains will cost 5 units fee. That means you can perform 20 transactions with 1 cent. 

For any smart contract creation and execution, the fee can be queried from the smart contract api. It all depends on the operation complexity. 

For each debit entry or credit entry, you can put a note. For the first 8 characters, it is 2 fee units
for the next 8 chars, it is 4 fee units. next 8 chars will be 16 units and next will be 256 units.
